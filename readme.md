 ### Motivation:
 Traditional voting systems face challenges in ensuring security, transparency, and
accessibility. Paper-based methods are susceptible to tampering, while existing digital solutions
often lack robust encryption and authorization mechanisms, potentially compromising the
integrity of the electoral process. The increasing demand for secure and efficient voting systems
in various contexts, from national elections to corporate decision-making, necessitates the
development of advanced digital voting solutions

Our projectâ€™s innovative approach lies in the integration of LFRS
encryption with a comprehensive authorization framework, specifically tailored for digital voting.We are designing a secure digital voting system that ensures voter privacy and prevents
fraud.
### Features:
1. Enhanced Security: The LFRS encryption provides a high level of security against
potential attacks, ensuring the integrity of each vote.
2. Efficient Verification: The system allows for easy verification of votes without compromising voter anonymity.
3. Scalability: The digital nature of the system makes it adaptable to various scales, from
small organizational votes to large national elections.
4. Accessibility: By leveraging digital platforms, our system increases accessibility for voters,
including those with physical limitations or geographical constraints.
